## Limitations

- The most prominent limitation of this KYC system is that it's proper functioning is heavily dependent on how it's going to be interacted with. The buttons are not turned off (i.e. made un-clickable) at any moment. So, if a participant decides to just go ahead and randomly start clicking the buttons in between transactions, the application is mostly likely going to report an error or even worse, it may crash. Therefore, patiently wait for the transaction to complete and the updates to appear on screen
